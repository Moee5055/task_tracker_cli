# task_tracker_cli

Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. In this task, we will build a simple command line interface (CLI) to track what we need to do, what we have done, and what we are currently working on. This project will help me practice my programming skills, including working with the filesystem, handling user inputs, and building a simple CLI application.
